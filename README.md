# 🧼 Dish Genie
*A smart dishwasher timer for the Adafruit MagTag (CircuitPython 10.x+)*

Dish Genie is a simple but fun MagTag project that lets you set a timer for your dishwasher cycle and get notified when it’s done — complete with custom e-Ink graphics, NeoPixel LED feedback, and button-driven control.

## ✨ Features
- 🕒 **Adjustable timer** — Increase timer by 30-minute increments, or reset to default (1 hour). In either 12 or 24 hour format!
- 🧽 **Visual dishwasher states** — “Dirty”, “Cleaning…”, and “Clean!” screens with custom BMP images.
- 💡 **LED notifications** — MagTag’s built-in NeoPixels blink in different colors for each state.
- 🔔 **Completion alert** — Audible jingle plays when the cleaning timer finishes.
- 🌐 **Real-time tracking** — Fetches the current time from Adafruit IO’s time integration.
- 🔋 **Low power sleep** — Uses `alarm` deep-sleep to conserve power between cycles.

## 💾 How It Works

1. On boot, the MagTag displays the Home screen (Dish Genie logo).
2. Press the **Cleaning** button to start the dishwasher timer.
3. The device fetches the current time via Adafruit IO and calculates the estimated finish time.
4. The MagTag goes into deep sleep until the timer expires (or a button is pressed).
5. When the timer ends, LEDs flash yellow, a tone plays, and the Clean! screen appears.

> *Rename `secrets.EXAMPLE.py` to `secrets.py` and fill in with your Network/AIO settings to fetch time.*
